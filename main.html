<div><h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures the time an algorithm takes to run based on the size of its input, helping to determine its efficiency. It is expressed using Big-O notation, like 𝑂(1)O(1) or 𝑂(𝑛)O(n), to show how performance scales. Choosing algorithms with optimal time complexity ensures they are more efficient for practical use.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total memory an algorithm requires to execute, including variables, inputs, and auxiliary structures. It is often expressed in Big-O notation, such as O(n), indicating how memory usage grows with input size. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize Space Complexity for better performance.</p>
